there is no way to put a happy face on the grim possibility that many people are
worshipping the wrong Christ instead of the Christ of the Bible. If the person
we call “Jesus” is not the same character that the Scriptures define, and
especially if that character opposes what Christ taught, then we have created an
idol of our own imagination, and we are not serving the real Jesus of the Bible.
There would be literally be no difference between between worshipping a statue
of wood or stone that we call “God,” and
creating a Jesus of our own imagination that never existed, and claiming <i><b> that</b></i> “idol” as our very
God! Is the false comfort of our &quot;mental&quot; idol more important than knowing the real Jesus Christ? Or
will we be fools and close our intellect to the fact that today many are
teaching “another” Christ that is not the Christ of the Bible?&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">As unpopular as
this question may be, God placed an immense importance upon the matter! My
purpose in writing is not to seek someone to condemn, nor is it to thump my
chest arrogantly claiming that my way is the only way, but it is with a heavy
heart that I breach the ground in which many see as sacred ecumenical ground.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">If God be true,
and the person who is worshipping a God of their own invention is doomed to Hell
for believing, [no matter how genuinely,] in the idol they erected above the One
True God, then in the interest of souls we must take a hard look at what we call
“God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">Gal
1:6-9 says, &quot;I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you <b>into
the grace of Christ </b>unto <b><u><span style="COLOR: red">another gospel</span></u></b>:
<b>Which is not <u>another;</u> but <u>there be some that trouble you</u>, and
would <u>pervert <i>the gospel of Christ</i></u><i>. </i>But though we, <i>or an
angel from </i>heaven, preach <i>any other gospel </i>unto you than that which
we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. </b>As we said before, so say I
now again, <b><u>If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have
received, let him be accursed</u>.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">By this one verse
alone, we can see that the One True God means business! There is no hint of
compromise in His statement! One thing that becomes painfully clear is, that in
the course of having “another” Christ, one inevitably holds to “another
gospel.” You see, if we have the Biblical Christ who said, “Go and sin no
more,” who rebuked the Pharisees for perverting the way to God to be by virtue
of one's own merit, we must conclude that any so-called “Christ” that is not concerned with personal holiness, or elevates personal
works as the way to salvation, has invented “another gospel” that matches
the flawed and unbiblical character of the false Christ they have invented.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;&quot;Moreover,
brethren, I declare unto you <u>the gospel which I preached unto you</u>, <u>which
also ye have received</u>, and in <u>which you stand</u> By which also <i>you

believed</i> in vain</u>. </font><font face="Arial" size="2"> 1 Cor. 15:1</font></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">Starting
right in the Gospel is no guarantee that one will remain faithful to the true
Gospel. Unfortunately, most people that are presently astray of the true Gospel
were educated into heresy <u><i><b> after</b></i></u> they have been saved. They started right, but do
not finish well. </font><span style="COLOR: #001320"><font face="Arial" size="2">[see Gal. 3:3]</font></span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">Paul
emphatically says that some people in his day received the true Gospel, and he
stated that it was essential that they “stand,” or more plainly stated, that
they “remain” in the truth of that Gospel, or they may have ultimately

<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#008000">There

  is describing a
  person that teaches and lives their life as a &quot;<b>practical antinomian.</b></u><b>&quot;</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">In a nutshell, an antinomian is a person that
  is either &quot;without law,&quot; or teaches others to be &quot;without
  law.&quot; It is to discard any rule of law or standard upon those they say
  are saved by grace. They convolute all conditions of the Gospel to be
  &quot;works,&quot; i.e., earning one's salvation. The Antinomian cannot differentiate
  between a faith that works, and a person working to save themselves. To them,
  it is all the same.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#008000"><b><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;Fundamental
  Christianity in our times is deeply influenced by that ancient enemy of
  righteousness, Antinomianism. The creed of the Antinomian is easily stated: We
  are saved by faith alone; works have no place in salvation; conduct is works,
  and is therefore of no importance. What we do cannot matter as long as we
  believe rightly. The divorce between creed and conduct is absolute and final.
  The question of sin is settled by the Cross; conduct is outside the circle of
  faith and cannot come between the believer and God. Such in brief, is the
  teaching of the Antinomian. And so fully has it permeated the Fundamental
  element in modern Christianity that it is accepted by the religious masses as
  the very truth of God. Antinomianism is the doctrine of grace carried by
  uncorrected logic to the point of absurdity. It takes the teaching of
  justification by faith and twists it into deformity.&quot; </font></b><font size="3" face="Arial"><span class="style3"><i>Paths
  to Power,</i> A.W. Tozer.&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The problem has existed in the Church since
  Biblical time; Paul countered the idea, <b><font color="#800000">&quot;Shall
  we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid!&quot;</font></b> in
  Romans 6:1-2. If some Antinomians did not suggest such an absurdity, it is
  unlikely that Paul would never have made mentioned of it or refuted it! <b><u><font color="#FF0000">It
  was heresy then, and it is still so today!</font></u></b></font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">This issue was strongly debated in the 1700's in England.
  The Reverend John Fletcher detailed it this way:</font></p>
</div>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white" class="ecxgtxtbody"><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#008000"><b>&quot;An Antinomian is a professor of Christianity, who is <i>antinomos,
</i>against the law of Christ, as well as against the law of Moses. He allows
Christ's law to be a rule of life, but not a rule of judgment for believers, and
thus he destroys that law at a stroke, as a law; it being evident that a ruled
by the personal observance or non-observance of which Christ's subjects can
never be acquitted or condemned, is not a law for them. Hence he asserts that
Christians shall no more be justified before God by their personal obedience to
the law of Christ, than by their personal obedience to the ceremonial law of
Moses. Nay, he believes that the best of Christians perpetually break Christ's
law; that nobody ever kept it but Christ Himself; and that we shall be justified
or condemned before God, in the great day, not as we shall personally be found
to have finally kept or broken Christ's law, but as God shall be found to have,
before the foundation of the world, arbitrarily laid, or not laid, to our
account, the merit of Christ's keeping His own law. Thus he hopes to stand in
the great day, merely by what he calls 'Christ's imputed righteousness';
excluding with abhorrence, from our final justification, the evangelical
worthiness of our own personal, sincere obedience of repentance and faith, — a
precious obedience this which he calls ‘dung, dross, and filthy rags' just as
if it were the insincere obedience of self-righteous pride, and Pharisaic
hypocrisy. Nevertheless, though he thus excludes the evangelical, derived worthi<span class="ecxgtxtbody1">ness
of the works of faith, from our eternal justification and salvation, he himself
does good works, if he is in other respects a good man. Nay, in this case, he
piques himself on doing them, thinking he is peculiarly obliged to make people
believe that, immoral as his sentiments are, they draw after them the greatest
benevolence and the strictest morality.&quot; </span>But there are multitudes
carelessly following the stream of corrupt nature who are crying out, not
against the unholiness, but against the “<i>legality, </i>of their wicked
hearts, which still suggest that they must <i>do something, </i>in order to
attain eternal life.&quot; They decry that evangelical legality which all true
Christians are in love with—a cleaving to Christ by that kind of faith which
works righteousness—a following Him as He went about doing good, and a showing
by St. James' <i>works </i>that we have St. Paul 's faith.</b></font></p>

so finished that no sins can ever blot his name out of the Book of Life</u>. He
thinks that the Son of God magnified the law that we might vilify it; that He
made it honorable, that we might make it contemptible; that He came to fulfill
it, that we might be discharged from fulfilling it, according to our capacity.

a sin, and if <b><i><u><font color="#FF0000"> all</font></u></i></b> sin is paid for, how can his Eternal Security ever fail me?

Churches today choose to ignore Scripture and history when they lower the bar of regeneration down to the lowest
possible level of the level of the
unregenerate; this defiant act makes regeneration unnecessary, or at the best a meaningless thing!
Apparently, swelling the ranks of their &quot;church&quot; is more important
than building the true Church of Jesus Christ! In direct defiance to God's Word,
they torture the idea of holiness of
heart and life that the Bible constantly pushes the Believer towards, as something optional, or worse, something

<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><font size="3">What
is our concept of God? What is our attitude towards sin? How do the two relate?
Do we have “God,” or a “god”? God says, <b>“Let the wicked forsake his
way and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him <i>return</i> unto the
Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly
pardon”</b> (Isa. 55:7).</font></span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><font size="3">The
Scriptures tell us that there are those who believe in God, “but your
iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his
face from you, that he will not hear. For your hands are defiled with blood, and
your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath
muttered perverseness” (Isa. 59: 2-3). “Draw nigh to God, and he will draw
nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye
double-minded; Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to
mourning, and your joy to heaviness. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord,
and he will lift you up“ (James 4: 8-10). He doesn’t just leave us in our
sin, merely changing our eternal destiny from hell to heaven; but He lifts us
up! <b><u>An ethical change happens in Regeneration</u></b>. Jesus came to save
us <u>FROM</u> our sins, not to save us <u>IN</u> our sins! (Matthew 1:25). <b><font color="#0000FF"> They
are teaching something strange about the atonement of Christ and Conversion;
namely the nonsense that “sin” is what gets Converted so it no longer damns, instead of
the Biblical idea that the Sinner gets Converted so they no longer sin through
the power of Christ which is able to keep them from falling! Show me, where is
sin ever stated to be the object of Conversion in the Bible!</font></b></font></span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><font size="3">“The
wages of sin is <u>death</u>” (Rom. 6:23). The soul that sinneth, it shall
die” (Ezek. 18:4). “<b>But when the righteous turneth away from his
righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the
abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness
that he hath done shall not be mentioned… when a wicked man turneth away from
his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right,
he shall surely live, he shall not die.” (Ezek. 18:24-28).</b>  <font color="#FF0000"> We can refuse
to believe it. We can revise it so it allows for the sin we refuse to repent of;
but that does not change the fact of God’s attitude and future judgment for
that sin. Many will dodge the obvious with all kinds of theological gymnastics,
but their self-delusions will not excuse them at the Judgment. </font> Contrary to what
many believe, this does not change God’s mind about sin! Sin has its wages; it
always damns, it always separates one from God. It cannot be hid or evaded. <b>Sin
separates the soul from God is the clear teaching of the Bible throughout.</b></font></span></p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal" class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><font size="3">Antinomians
refuse to accept the plain meaning of this passage since it undoes their
unbiblical theory! Does sin matter after we are saved? Yes! Look at the passage
and notice that it is written about and to those that “were sanctified,” a
term never used for anything other than a genuine Christian!</font></span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><font size="3"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">For
if we sin [Present Tense Greek, <u>while we keep on sinning</u>] willfully after
we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice
for sins… This is important to note that the writer speaks of someone who not
only willfully sins, but continues to do so <u>now</u>. It is an unrepentant
state, a state of unbelief. He tells us plainly that for such a one, there
remains no more sacrifice for their sins. Our Antinomian proponents write me and
say that this passage is about assurance! They say that “there remaineth no
more sacrifice for sins” is a <u>positive statement</u>, meaning that this
warning is really no warning at all because since Jesus died on the Cross, no
more sacrifices for sin are necessary. This is without a doubt, eisegesis at its
worst! The writer is not speaking of a general fact about the atonement of
Christ that applies to every person living, but to the one who was a Christian
and is now presently sinning willfully! There is no more sacrifice for sins <u>for
them</u>! The writer immediately tells us what the absence of a
sacrifice for sins results in… a <b><u>certain</u></b> <b>fearful looking for
of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries…</b>
Wow! According to our Antinomian “gospel,” the writer of the Book of Hebrews
should have said, “God is going to take your rewards away from you, but will
save you! This is idiotic! The passage says nothing of rewards burned, but what
it does say is, these people will suffer a certain fiery judgment of indignation
that God reserves for the worst of the worst, to include the devil and any of
God’s adversaries! Nothing could be plainer! To emphasize this we are told,
“how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath
trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, <i>wherewith
he <b>was sanctified</b></i>, and unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the
Spirit of grace?” (Heb. 10: 26-29). “As long as we are spurning that remedy
we have no hope of recovery… but every backslider has the gracious promise of
Isa. 55:7; “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts: <i>and let him return unto the Lord, </i>and he will have mercy upon
him; and to our God, for he will abundantly</span><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black">

who walk away from the truth are not &quot;sinning saints,&quot; or other cute

<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black"><font size="3">The
important point to notice is that those who have received knowledge of the truth
have been sanctified by the blood of the covenant may go back to willful sin, in
which case they separate themselves from the redeeming grace of the Lord Jesus.
To say this refers to those who are not real Christians is to handle the Word of
God deceitfully.</font></span></p>

Antinomian explanation of these passages is so patently absurd and desperate, that if I

they do by claiming to give a &quot;Biblical exposition.&quot; It is obvious
that they have nothing more than unbiblical bias and dogmatic propaganda for an
answer! It is deceit and not exposition!</font></span></p>

says, that “God shall judge the secrets of men, according to his Gospel.”
Peter asks, “What shall be the end of those who obey not the Gospel of God?”
and the apostle answers, “Christ, revealed in flaming fire, will take
vengeance on them who obey not the Gospel,” that is, all the ungodly who
“receive the grace of God in vain, or turn it into lasciviousness.” They do
not perish because the Gospel is a lie with respect to them, but “because they
receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.” God, to punish
their rejecting the truth, permits that they should believe a lie; “that they
all might be damned, who, <i>to the last hour of their day of grace</i>,
believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.” </font></b><font size="2"> [Fletcher]</font></span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><font size="3">John’s
Gospel, eighth chapter, verses thirty-four to thirty-six inclusive. Jesus
answered them, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, <b><i>Whosoever committeth sin
is the servant of sin. </i></b>And the servant <u>abideth not</u> in the house
forever, but the Son abideth ever. If the Son, therefore, shall make you free, <b><i>ye
shall be free indeed</i></b> .” If this is true, and you commit sin, you are
not God’s children but servants of sin, for, “<b>To whom ye yield yourselves
servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey</b>” (Rom. 6:16). You
cannot serve sin and righteousness, God and the devil, or heaven and hell, at
the same time. The line must be drawn, discrimination made, and we must either
be Christians and abstain from sin, or sinners and indulge in sin.”</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">John writes in
his First Epistle, “My little children, these things I write unto you, that ye
sin not.” (Gk, a singular act of sin.) (2:1). “And <b><i>if </i></b>any man
sin” (not “<b><u>when</u></b>”). (2:1).., “He that saith, I know him,
and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.”
(2:4). “He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none
occasion of stumbling in him.” (2:10). “Whosoever abideth in him sinneth
not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.” (3:6). “He
that committeth sin is of the devil.” (3: 8). “Whosoever is <b><i><u>born of
God</u></i></b> doth not commit sin;” (3:9). Notice that this does not speak
of maturity, advanced sanctification, education, etc., it speaks of the grace to
<i><u>not sin</u></i> occurring at the New-Birth. “Little children, let no man
deceive you: he that doeth righteousness <i>is</i> righteous, even as <i>he</i>
is righteous.” (3:7). “For whatsoever is born of God overcommeth the world:
and this is the victory that overcommeth the world, even our faith.” (5:4).
“We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of
God keepeth himself, and the wicked one toucheth him not.” (5:18). “If we
say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not
the truth.” (1:6). John says point blank that sinning, or walking in the
darkness was incompatible with being a Christian. He says so at least 5 times
throughout his First Epistle.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">Will you believe
that Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil and to save us <b><i><u>from</u></i></b>
our sins? (1 Jn. 3:8, Matt. 1:21). That he who sins is of the devil? (1 Jn.
3:9-10). That we are commanded, &quot;<b><i><u>Be ye</u></i></b> holy, for I am
holy&quot;; not, <i><u>try</u></i> to be holy? (1 Peter 1:15,16). That John
believed this when he wrote, &quot;My little children, I write these things unto
you that you <i><u>may not sin</u></i>. (Gk. One time!)? (1 Jn. 2:1). Will you
believe the Bible when it says, &quot;if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die:
but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall
live.&quot;? (Romans 8:13). Do you see that even with inflation, &quot;the wages
of sin is death&quot;? (Rom. 6:23). God said that sin <i><u>always</u></i>
brings death when He told Adam and Eve, &quot;In the day you eat thereof, ye
shall surely die!&quot; Or will you choose to be in poor company by siding with
the devil, chanting his soul-damning lie, &quot;Surely, you shall not die&quot;?
May I remind you, &quot;Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants
to obey, his servants ye are to whom you obey; whether of sin unto death, or of
obedience unto righteousness?&quot; (Rom. 6:16). “For sin shall not have
dominion over you… (Rom. 6:14). Paul, writing to true believers, Born-Again
Christians, &quot;But now being made free <b><i><u>from</u></i></b> sin, and

believe them! But none of these conditions say or imply that they
&quot;merit&quot; salvation with God! Yet salvation cannot be said to exist
without them. Conditions are not the Boogey-man! Look at this example:</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif"><font color="#000080"><b>A radio
station calls you up and says, &quot;We have chosen you for a free trip to Jamaica
on July 12th of this year, and you accept the gift. Now, did you &quot;earn&quot; the
Jamaica trip by accepting it? Is going to the airport and getting on the plane
to Jamaica &quot;earning&quot; the trip? Is being on the plane before the July
12th deadline a meritorious work or earning the trip? Do you return home and
brag how you &quot;earned&quot; a trip to Jamaica by being on time, going to the
airport and getting on a plane? People would look at you like you were crazy if
you argued such a thing! Yet Antinomians do the same thing to all the conditions of
Scripture, and condemn the honest Christian to Hell for saying that they are wrong!</b></font></span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif">Being

<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><b>There
are actually those who through their actions, have fallen from grace. They have
rejected grace by adding certain works to the true Gospel of salvation by grace
through faith. T<font color="#000080">hey add baptism, or being good, social work, and even faith in a
doctrine, such as Calvinism or Eternal Security to the Gospel, and replace faith in Jesus
Christ alone for salvation, with their false &quot;gospel&quot;! </font></b> Those that are Antinomian generally accuse anyone that
accepts that a faithful present tense obedient faith is God’s revealed
condition for salvation, as somehow being lost and going to Hell! They falsely
call Biblical obedience and faith to be a “works salvation.”&nbsp; <b>There is
a vast difference between legalism, which is an effort to “earn” salvation
or “add” to grace, and being a believer that love and obeys God, and works
because God is working in and through them! The later would never view or claim
that they were going to heaven for any other reason than the atoning death and
resurrection of Jesus Christ.</b></span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><b><u><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Legalism
is a sin</span></u></b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">; <b>it
is every bit as damning as License!</b> Many Legalists I know are “good”
people in the worldly use of the term, but they are without grace. They do not
seem to understand that by adding to grace, they are denying grace. <b>“<span style="COLOR: #001320">And
if by grace, then <i>is it</i> no more of works: otherwise grace is no more
grace. But if <i>it be</i> of works, then is it no more grace:</span></b><span style="COLOR: #001320">

dies in vain.</b></span></span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif"><font color="#000080">What
are you trusting in for your salvation? Ask yourself, if you were to die today
and face God at the Judgment Seat, and He was to ask you why you should be
admitted to His Heaven, what would you say? If your answer has anything to do
with Church attendance, tithing, how wet you got when you were baptized, or that
you believe Eternal Security, then you have fallen from grace, and you will not
be entering in! The only acceptable answer is what Jesus did for us upon the
Cross; that is our only hope.</font></span></b></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: #001320">Take
a hard look at the book of Galatians, which was written to address this problem
within the Church. Well-meaning people throughout history have become passionate
about many things, and were even concerned about not being ungrateful towards
God by encouraging or excusing sin. Yet, in their passion they had crossed the
line. Their pet doctrines became a standard of who was saved and who was not. <b>
They trusted in something in addition to the grace of Christ, which would be
telling Jesus that they did not believe that His atonement was adequate, but
must be improved upon in some way.</b> <b><u>What a slap in the face to Jesus Christ
who did it all</u>!</b> You see, we can be in unbelief by saying that the Cross
was not good enough to save us, and we can show our unbelief by sinning and
presuming upon the grace of God like the Antinomian. <b>Legalism is unbelief in
the grace of God!&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></span></p>

THE TRUE JESUS OF THE BIBLE</span></b></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">It would
be illogical to say that in order to find the “TRUE” Christ of the Bible,
all we have to do is split the difference between the extremes. Bible truth is
never founded on the premise of moderation or finding a <i><font color="#000080"> via
media</font>.</i> Many attempt
to do this, believing that they find truth this way. Truth is truth whether it
is in the middle, or at the extremes.</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">I
would assert that the Christ of the Bible is an ethical Christ, and is also true
that the Bible states that the death of Christ is adequate and needs no outside
help to save a person.</span></b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">
<font color="#800000"> </font>
<u><font color="#800000">The truth is in this case, not at either extreme, but is actually absent in
these extremes</font></u><font color="#800000">. </font> Grace must take into account our ignorance and humanity to a
degree. It is doubtful that any individual would know with absolute perfection
and accuracy, everything there is to know about the “true” Jesus Christ. The
Bible draws a line to the north and to the south, and if we cross these
well-defined lines, we have left the latitude of the Gospel. Somewhere in-between
legalism and antinomianism, is the Christ of the Bible. This leaves room for
those within the lines, some space and freedom for friendly disagreement and debate without rejecting
each other as heretics.</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">John
15:4-6, &quot;Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
itself, except it abide in the vine: no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am
the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same <b>bringeth
forth much fruit</b>: For without me ye can do nothing.&quot; Salvation and
fruit bearing are inseparable; you cannot have one without the other. If we are
saved, we must bear fruit because we are in the vine. If we do not produce good
works, it is only evidence that we are not one of His! The works we do are
accomplished from the fact that Christ is working them through us. He is the sap
and energy of our spiritual life. We have a part in this work, but since our
hearts have been changed to do them with a right motive through regeneration,
God generously gives us rewards for what he produces through us. The continuance
in faith, or the works that are a product of this faith, is not in any way
earning salvation through works. There is no merit in casting ourselves upon the
mercy of God as sinners who are without any hope of earning our salvation.</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: #001320">John
Fletcher stated, </span><b><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif"><font color="#008000"> “We are not to do good works to obtain heaven by them, [as if
they were the properly meritorious cause of our salvation.] <u>T</u></font><u>his proud,

a life of obedient faith, and are disgusted at those who would use their
doctrines to promote rank antinomianism in practice. But as we have seen, today
in this world, there really exists&nbsp; a segment in our Churches that preaches rank antinomianism, and damns
anyone who does not fall in the ditch of error with them, as “evil,”
“satanic,” “work salvationist's,” and “going to Hell.”</font></font></b></span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">This
heretical segment is very energetic, and while most Antinomians I have met are
going to Churches that would disagree with them, Antinomians choose to promote
their propaganda through the use of deceit and subversion from within,
attempting to break down their Churches, one person at a time. For some reason
their Antinomian heresy is tolerated, and they are not asked to
leave. Perhaps it is because they believe the same un-Biblical doctrines of Eternal
Security, Imputed Righteousness of Christ, and sins paid for, past, present, and
future, which the Antinomian only takes to their logical antinomian end. How can
you argue with such irrefutable consistency? The pastor's of such Churches
sheepishly avoid
doing anything about it, because they see that it would seem unbiblical to do so. Following the
doctrine of Eternal Security to its inevitable conclusion, one must see that
there is virtually no light between speculative Antinomianism and practical Eternal
Security.</span></p>
