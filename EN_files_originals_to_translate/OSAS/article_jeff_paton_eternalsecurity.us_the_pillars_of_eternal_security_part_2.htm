<p>In the <a href="http://eternalsecurity.us/pillars_of_eternal_security%20part%20two.htm">Eight
Pillars of Eternal Security</a>, I thought that the main pillars had suffered
enough erosion that the idol of unconditional eternal security would teeter and
fall. Even without the main pillars to support this teaching, the worshipers of this doctrinal goddess have
rushed in to prop up their idol once again. With much religious fervor, new pillars
have been swiftly erected in their place as the stability of the old ones have
collapsed. There is little hope that we will see the disappearance of this
doctrine, not only because of its popularity, but also because one would their license
for sin. If someone abandoned carnal security, all excuses for sin would be lost, and the
dulled conscience would be livened again to the vast holiness of the living God.
They would be faced with a dilemma they have ignored; compliance or
condemnation. Those that don't <i><b><u>want</u></b></i> to comply, will tenaciously
cling to their idol, no matter how much evidence there is against it, and no
matter how paper thin the arguments are for it. Whether the Scriptures support
it, is of no concern to them. They make their idol <i>&quot;the gospel,&quot; </i>and
condemn anyone as deceived and lost for not accepting it. They heap eternal hell
and condemnation upon those who do not worship their doctrine, which was carved
out of wood and stone! Earthy rationalization from the mind of men becomes the
basis of God's truth, and not the spiritual revelation of His Word!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the second part of this article I will peer underneath these pillars and
will examine the substrata which they use to support the weight of these
doctrines. Once there is no <u>Biblical</u> support in sight, they routinely
fall back on unproven theological <i>presuppositions</i> to justify their
conclusions. This tactic is their last refuge, it gets you away from Scripture
and distracts you from the truth! Do not let their slight of hand distract you,
the only thing that is important is <a href="http://eternalsecurity.us/200_reasons%20Eternal%20Security%20is%20false.htm">what
does the Bible prove?</a> and not, what does some imaginary <i>theory</i> prove!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

PILLAR NINE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</font></b><font color="#ff0000"><i>
<p>Verily, verily, I say unto you. He that heareth my word, and believeth on him
that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation: but
is passed from death unto life.</i></font>&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>John
5:24</b></p>
</i></font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the writing of the Eight Pillars of Eternal Security, this passage has
been quoted as the Goliath that must be struck dead. The emphasis that is made is- <i><u>hath</u></i>
eternal life.....<u><i>shall not</i></u> come into condemnation.....<i><u>is
passed</u></i> from death unto life.</p>
<p>This is the same perpetuated error that eternal security proponents make in
their interpretation of John 10:27-29. The English does not clearly exhibit the
present tense of the Greek. The <i>hearing</i> and <i>believing</i> are in the <i><b>present
tense.</b></i> The condition of having everlasting life is that we are hearing
and believing right <u><i>now!</i></u> This is not some <i>past</i> act of a moment
that secures these promises. It is impossible for one who ceases to continue in
the required <i>hearing</i> and <i>believing</i> to have the blessings and
promises connected to it.</p>
<p><font color="#000080"><b>The </b></font> <i><font color="#000080"><b>substrata:</b></font> </i>The conclusions derived from the Greek are definite and
unavoidable. To salvage this text for their cause, they deviate from the prior
condition and argue the word &quot;eternal.&quot; They say &quot; If <i>eternal
life</i> is<i> &quot;eternal,&quot;</i> how can it be lost? The believer <i><u>hath</u></i>
everlasting life, and that cannot end! If the<i> everlasting</i> life you
receive from God ever ceases for any reason, it was not <i>&quot;everlasting.&quot;</p>
</i>
<p>This <i><b>assumes</b></i> that eternal life exists as a possession apart
from faith. If someone possessed an eternal pearl of great price, then later
they cast the pearl off in favor of something else, that does not make the pearl
any less &quot;eternal.&quot; It does however cease to be the possession of the
one who cast it off. &quot;Eternal life&quot; itself does not lose its quality
because of one’s unbelief. However, the possession of this quality of life is
no longer owned by the one who no longer meets the Scriptural conditions stated.
The fact that they <i><u>now</u></i> possess everlasting life is because they
are <i>hearing</i> and <i>believing</i> <i><u>now.</p>
</u></i>
<p>This is not salvation by merit as some will charge, but it is the consistent
definition of saving faith throughout the Scriptures. The one who clings to a
lifeguard for rescue from drowning does not claim their &quot;clinging,&quot; or
absence of resistance as the cause of their deliverance. The lifeguard gets the
deserved credit, but cannot save the one who fights or refuses his help. It
would also be foolish to assume that since one was saved from drowning, that it
would be impossible for them to become careless and fall in the water and drown
in the future! Such is the logic of eternal security.</p>
<p>They <i>shall not come into condemnation.</i> The same condition applies. If
they continue to <i>hear</i> and <i>believe</i>, they have no fear of
condemnation. <i>But is passed (perfect tense) from death to life.</i> This is
truly the state of the one who <i><b>presently </b>hears and believes.</i> He
was dead, and was made alive, and <i><b>continues</b></i> to live today as the perfect
tense implies. This is the<a href="http://eternalsecurity.us/hold_on!.htm">
abiding, continuing, and enduring </a>that the Bible exhorts believers to do. It
is important to note that the verse says nothing whatsoever about those who
cease hearing and believing. In fact, the Scriptures have no promises of
blessings for those who trample under foot the blood of Christ! Based upon the
conclusions already given it would be sound advice to follow Paul and Barnabas
who are in agreement with our Lord’s statement by &quot;speaking to them,
persuaded them to <i><u><b>continue</b></u></i> in the grace of God&quot; (Acts
13:43).</p>

PILLAR TEN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt
be saved. </font></i><font color="#ff0000"><i><b>Romans 10:9</b></p>
</i></font>
<p>Although this is not used on a regular basis by eternal security proponents,
it is included since it is the allegation of some that it posits
unconditional eternal security.</p>
<p>The emphasis on this verse is usually given as &quot;God says that if you <i>confess</i>
with your mouth, and <i>believe</i> in your heart that God raised Jesus from the
dead, <i>thou shalt be saved. <b> PERIOD!</b></i> The argument says that the condition
of confession and belief have been met at an altar of prayer, then the promise
is sure....thou shalt be saved. The conditions are met and the promise
guaranteed. God cannot lie.</p>
<p>There is a lot of merit in these words, but the context of the verse is <i><u>not</u></i>
talking of <i><b> final</b></i> salvation. It is dealing with the <i><b> reception of salvation</b></i> <i><u>now</u>.</i>
The context is talking about justification, receiving righteousness by faith. We
would associate this with the popular term &quot;getting saved.&quot;</p>
<p>Nothing within the context would give us any warrant to force an
unconditional eternal security upon &quot;thou shalt be saved.&quot; Eternal
Security is not even implied in the passage. One can read it into it, but cannot
get the doctrine out of it; unless they <b><i>presuppose</i></b> that it is
there. That would not be sound exegesis. Such loose methods of interpretation
would leave the Bible a thing that is subject to personal opinion. This is
dangerous; anything.., I mean <b><i><u>ANYTHING</u></i></b> could be proved with
this method!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some have argued that the Greek word used here is in the aorist tense, that
is, an act of the moment. A singular act of belief that brings about salvation.
This is true that the moment we believe, God saves us. The context of the
passage leaves us there. <u> It is important to know that the Scripture is
consistent in the use of the <i><b>present tense</b></i> wherever the conditions of
<b> <i>final</i>
salvation</b> are stated.</u> <b><i> This passage is no exception since it does not consider
anything other than the believers initial passing from death unto life.</i></b></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><b>The </b></font> <i><font color="#000080"><b>substrata:</b></font> </i>Although the theological underpinning that I am about
to bring forth is not directly related to this verse, but it is commonly used by
eternal security proponents when they fail to find Biblical support.</p>
<p>&quot;We must be eternally secure because Jesus paid for our sins past,
present, and future.&quot; It is an interesting challenge if you ask them to
prove this supposition. They are <i><u>assuming</u></i> that you will be
logically defeated by buying into this reasoning. <b> They can search the Scriptures
day and night forever, and they will never find <i>any</i> proof of this
statement.</b> In fact, the Scriptures lead us to another conclusion. We are told
that <i><b>if</b></i> we sin, we have an Advocate with the Father. That is, a
Lawyer. Now if all your future violations of the law were already paid for, then
you would never need an Advocate. The Judge is already satisfied, and no
punishment can be inflicted on the one who's fine is already paid for. The fact that
Jesus is the Advocate for the believer (1 Jn. 2:1) is evidence enough that <i>future</i>
sin is not automatically covered. We would not need an Advocate if we were
already judicially paid for at the cross as the Eternal Security proponent
asserts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that the Bible never states that future sins are forgiven is more
than innuendo based upon the idea of a need for an Advocate. Paul makes a direct reference concerning the forgiveness of sins in Romans
3:24, 25. &quot;Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that
is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith
in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the <b> <i>remission of sins that are</i>
<u><i>past</i></u>,</b> through the forbearance of God.&quot;</p>
<p>John says
</font>

 i<font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">t is only <b><i>if</i> </b>we confess our sins that He is faithful and just
to forgive us our sins (1 Jn.1:9). No promise of forgiveness can be found in
Scripture for
those who refuse to repent. To say that <i><u> all</u></i> future sins are covered when we
first believe is a theological <i><b>assumption</b></i> and not a Biblical <i><u>fact</u></i>.&nbsp;We
have clear and indisputable statements that <b><i>past sins </i></b>are covered
in the atonement, yet we are at a total loss to find a <b><i>singular </i></b>passage
that states, or even implies, that all future sins of a believer are already
pre-forgiven.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people will base their eternal salvation on an unproven <b>a<i>ssumption</i>
</b>that allows them safety in their sin. Anything concerning salvation that
cannot be proven from the Scriptures is nothing more than a baseless theory.
Theories are alright if they are used to support that which is clearly defined
in Scripture. They are dangerous if they are used as a <i>foundation</i> for any
doctrine. This past, present, and future <i><b>theory</b></i> was developed to
support and bolster their theory of final perseverance. Without any Scriptural
evidence to support this teaching, their theory of future payment turns out to
be faith in a <i><b>gargantuan assumption!</b></i> This approach is prime
breading ground for doctrinal idols, and not for truth!</p>

PILLAR ELEVEN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</font></b><font color="#ff0000"><i>
<p align="center">And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed
unto the day of redemption.</i></font> <b><font color="#ff0000"><i>Ephesians
4:30</p>
</i></font></b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a lot of ways this is the same as Pillar Eight. Much ado is made of the
word <i>&quot;sealed&quot;</i> within both of these passages as proof that the
carnal &quot;christian&quot; is secure. Also, much emphasis is put upon the
statement <i>&quot;unto the day of redemption.&quot;&nbsp; </i>Because of the
inordinate stress that the advocates of this theory put upon these words, I find
it necessary to give more attention to the subject than what has already been
given in the original Pillars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again I want to underscore that the word <i>&quot;seal&quot;</i> in
itself makes no allusion to a doctrine of unconditional security whatsoever. It
does speak of security which cannot be denied, but nowhere does the word itself
define the extent of that security. The word <i>&quot;seal&quot;</i> in itself
does not give us the mode in which we are sealed, nor does the word itself give
any indication whether the seal can be broken or not. Many will charge that this
is clarified by the clause <i>&quot;unto the day of redemption.&quot;</i> They
read <i>&quot;unto,&quot; </i>the Greek<i> &quot;eis&quot;</i> as <u>till,</u>
or <u>all the way to</u> the day of redemption. They see this as proving that
the seal is guaranteed through to the day of His coming. This stems from a
misinterpretation of the ambiguous <i>&quot;unto&quot;</i> of the King James
version and by not looking at the original Greek. All versions of the Scriptures
since the KJV, and the unanimous consensus of the Greek scholarship of our day
goes against this interpretation. Most translate this passage as, <i>&quot;for
the day of redemption.&quot;</i> The idea of the passage is that we were sealed
with a <i><b>view</b></i> to the day of redemption. The passage does not say that we
are guaranteed this sealing <i><b>all the way to</b> </i>the day of redemption, or are
sure of our arrival at this designated end. The possibility of grieving the Holy
Spirit, which is the &quot;seal&quot;, implies that this passage is meant as a <u>
warning</u> and not as a passage of assurance as the Eternal Security proponents
demand. This verse admits the possibility of grieving the Holy Spirit, which
implies that there is a real danger and that this seal can be broken.</p>
<p><font color="#000080"><b>The <i>substrata</i>:</b></font> Many allude to the ancient custom of using a wax seal
as a mark of ownership. There is also the idea of preserving an item in a
container, such as jelly or preserves. These references are not complete ideas
in which we can take every aspect of them and force them upon Scripture. In
fact, the Scripture <i><b>never</b> </i>specifies how this <i>&quot;sealing&quot; </i>is
applied.</p>
<p><b>For example:</b> A wax seal of ownership is independent of the object which is
sealed. Thus, many say that from this image, we cannot break this seal
ourselves. As for the jar of preserves; the item inside remains uncontaminated
as long as the seal is not broken, or, the seal remains unbroken if the contents
remain uncontaminated and do not fester. Since the Bible makes no mention of
exactly <i>how</i> this sealing happens, it would be wrong to force any idea too
far in either direction. This would be reading too much into these verses.
Interjecting our preferred idea of what we think this sealing is into this
passage would prove a theory, but it would not prove that it is the idea of
Scripture.</p>
<p>Another <i><font color="#000080"><b>substrata</b></font> </i>that the eternal security crowd falls back upon is
the use of <i>anthropomorphisms, </i>I.E. human images used to describe God’s
relationship to us. Images such as Father, Good Shepard, son, Judge, etc,... are
anthropomorphisms. The fact that God is our Father is sometimes used in a way
that goes beyond the plain words of Scripture. For an example, here is an actual
quote from an eternal security advocate:</p>
<p><i>&quot;No matter how much I tell my father that I am not his son, the TRUTH
of the matter is that I will ALWAYS be his son, regardless of where I go or what
I do, and I can never change his genes within me that bear witness to this. And
likewise with God, no matter how much I try to tell him that I am no longer his
son, I will ALWAYS be his son and will be unable to remove his spiritual
&quot;genes.&quot; The Holy Spirit was &quot;intercoursed&quot; into my spirit
when I was saved.&quot;</i></p>
<p>The problem with arguments like these, besides that they go against the clear
words of Scripture, is that they sometimes prove too much! We were all born
children of the devil; according to the above argument, we cannot lose our
son-ship because genetics cannot be changed. All this proves is that no one can
ever become a child of God! Besides, we are adopted into the family of God
aren’t we? Look at what foolish lengths this logic will take us if we apply
these images too far! There is nothing Biblical about the above quotation, but
people buy into these arguments every day, even the absurdity of being
&quot;sexed&quot; into salvation! We must be careful not to get carried away in
the application of these thoughts. They were never intended to be used to build
extensive theories and systems of theology.</p>
<b><font color="#ff8000" size="4">
<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;THERE IS NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</font></b>
<p>If old proofs are defeated we can be sure that new ones will always be put in
their place. We must be forever vigilant in what we accept as truth, or
otherwise, we will build one pillar of error that will someday become a temple.
I pray that we will all be willing to tear down those false pillars as they
become evident to us. Our assurance is not in a doctrine but in a vital union
with our Savior Jesus Christ. &quot;We also are men of like passions with you,
and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living
God.&quot; Acts 14:15</p>
