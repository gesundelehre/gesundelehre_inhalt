<p align="center"><font color="#000000">I have the unnamed author's statements
in </font><font color="#800000"><b><u>RED.</u></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000"><i>Here is the dialog and argument...</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#800000" size="3">There is a lot debate today on losing one’s
salvation. I’ve decided to boil it down to 2 simple steps to make it easy for
you.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000" size="3"><b>1. Do something that causes you to lose it.</b>
Now, I don’t know what that &quot;something&quot; could be because Paul never
talked about it and since Paul is the apostle to the Gentiles and the revealer
of the body of Christ to us today then he would be the one to tell us what to do
to lose it. Since Paul spent 13 epistles expounding Christ and justification
surely he would spend some time on how to lose it!</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I suggest that you should look again at the writings of
the Paul...&nbsp; <i><u><b>this time with your eyes open!</b></u></i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>Paul tells us how!</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>If we DEFILE THE TEMPLE, THE BODY, HE WILL
DESTROY US! (1 Cor. 3:16-17; 6:19-20; Heb. 12:15).</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>If we OBEY SIN we will DIE spiritually!
(Romans 6:16-23).</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>By NOT ABIDING IN THE FAITH we shall be cut
off! (Romans 11:11-32).</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>By being REMOVED FROM Christ! (Gal. 1:6-7).</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>By becoming ENTANGLED AGAIN with the yoke
of bondage! (Gal. 5:1).</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>By FALLING FROM GRACE! (Gal. 5:4). CHRIST
BECOMES OF NO EFFECT FOR US!</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>By WALKING AFTER THE FLESH and not the
Spirit! (Romans 8:1; 8:4; 8:12-13; Gal. 5:10, 20).</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>By not keeping your body under and becoming
a CASTAWAY. (1 Cor. 9:27).</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>By ERRING FROM THE FAITH. (1 Tim. 6:9-10,
21).</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>By DEPARTING FROM THE FAITH! (1 Tim. 4:1).</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>By having your faith OVERTHROWN! (2 Tim.
2:17-18).</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>By CASTING OFF your faith! (1 Tim. 5:11-15;
6:19-21; 2 Tim. 2:17;, 18; 4:10).</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>If we DENY HIM, HE WILL DENY US! (2 Tim.
2:12).</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">I have tried to give a good spread of Paul’s
doctrine concerning the matter. I limited it to Paul since that is what our
author wished to do. It is pretty obvious that Paul certainly spent some time explaining it!
Unfortunately, people like our author will expend the vast wealth of their
efforts in getting people to disbelieve it! Quite a shame. In addition to this,
at least one hundred more passages can be appealed to if we broaden the scope to
accept all of Scripture!</font></p>
<p><font size="3">&nbsp;<font color="#800000"><b>2. Undo all that God did at
your salvation.</b> See how easy it is! Now, let’s go down a simple list of
things that God did and all you have to do is make this list your check list and
mark them all as you undo them. OK put your tennis shoes on and let’s go!!!&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#800000" size="3"><b>1) Get God to un-forgive you –– Eph.
1:7</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">God does not un-forgive anybody. He also does
not forgive anybody for sins not yet committed. &quot;If&quot; any man sin, he
is in need of an Advocate (1 John 2:1-2). If one fails to seek reconciliation
with God after they have sinned, and continues in that sin unrepentant, there
remains no more sacrifice for their sins (Heb. 10:26; 1 Jn. 1:9). God does not
&quot;un-forgive&quot; anything. It is our failure to receive forgiveness by
refusing to turn to God for that forgiveness.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000" size="3"><b>2) Get God to un-redeem you - Rom. 3:24</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">The redemption is for past sins only (3:25).
Upon the condition of believing, (v.26), and faith, (v.28). If you refuse to lay
hold of redemption through belief and faith, by rejecting it through unbelief
and lack of faith; it is not God who &quot;un-redeems&quot; you, but your
rejection of that redemption.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000" size="3"><b>3) Get God to un-circumcise you –– Col.
2:13</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">&quot;Seeing it is one God, which shall
justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith&quot;
(Romans 3:30). For without faith it is impossible to please Him (Heb.11:6).
&quot;For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a
breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision&quot; (Rom.
2:25).&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">Our writer fails to read the exhortation in
its context. Colossians chapter Two, precedes these words on circumcision with
the following: &quot;And this I say, lest any man beguile you with enticing
words. For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in spirit, joying
and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ...
Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the
traditions of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ&quot;
(Col. 2:4-5, 8). Paul commends them for their steadfastness in the faith, and
with that commendation, he gives these stable believers a warning not to be
&quot;beguiled&quot; by enticing words. He further emphasizes this warning by
not to be &quot;spoiled&quot; through philosophy and vain deceit. His confidence
that he states following this portion of the argument that he makes is of a
positive tone, which is based upon their track record of steadfastness. It is an
impossible hermeneutic to apply these positive statements to those that fail to
heed his aforementioned warnings. Circumcision spoken of here is spiritual, not
a physical act which cannot be undone. Man chooses to disavow their spiritual
circumcision if they refuse to walk in faith (1 Jn. 1:7).&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b><font color="#800000" size="3">4) Get God to un-adopt you –– Rom. 8:15</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">This appeal to adoption ignores not only the
context, but the fact that this is a spiritual adoption which is obtained though
faith. Those that are adopted must meet the preceding conditions: &quot;For if
ye live by the flesh, ye shall die: but is through the Spirit do mortify the
deeds of the body, ye shall live&quot; (Romans 8:13).</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000" size="3"><b>5) Get God to un-seat you –– Eph. 2:6</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">The &quot;us&quot; that Paul speaks of as
being seated in heavenly places is the Church. People are seated there as long
as they are connected with the Body of Faith. &quot;For by grace are we saved
through faith&quot; (Eph. 2:8). This without a doubt implies the condition in
which one is translated into this high position. &quot;Through faith,&quot; it
is acquired, &quot;through faith&quot; we are kept in place (1 Peter 1:5). We
stay there as long as we do not make shipwreck of that faith (1 Tim. 1:19), or
have slipped away from that faith (Heb.2:1-3). We can lose our faith, and our
position of being seated in heavenly places by being deceived by sin and
departing from God (Heb. 3:12-13).&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000" size="3"><b>6) Get God to un-sanctify you –– I Cor.
6:11</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">One &quot;un-sanctifies&quot; themselves,
through persistent sinning and unrepentance (Heb. 10:26). They are no longer
set aside for a holy purpose, for it is said... &quot;Of how much sorer
punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot
the Son of God, and hath <b><i>counted the blood </i></b>of the covenant, <b><i>wherewith
he was sanctified,</i></b> an unholy thing, and <i><b>hath done despite unto the
Spirit of grace</b></i><b>?</b> For we know him that hath said, ‘Vengeance
belongeth unto me, <b><i>I will recompense,</i></b> saith the Lord.’ And
again, ‘<b>The Lord shall judge his <u>people.</u></b>’ 'It is a fearful
thing to fall into the hands of the living God' (Heb. 10:29, 30).&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000" size="3"><b>7) Get God to un-glorify you –– Rom.
8:30</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">Romans 8:28-39, speaks of a universal chain
and promise to a category of persons. The &quot;us&quot; and &quot;those&quot;
within the passage refers to the Church. One receives these promises in and only
when they remain as part of the Body, the Church. The Church is truly called,
predestinated, justified, and glorified in the mind of God. The characteristic
if one who is part of this Church is that they love God, (v. 28), there lives
are conformed to the image of the Son in holiness, (29), they are &quot;more
than conquerors&quot; in their faith (V.37). You see, the one that is already
considered as glorified in the mind of God are those who are here and now
conformed to the image of the Son. That is because they &quot;love God.&quot;
And through this love and conforming to holiness, they are &quot;more than
conquerors.&quot; The current &quot;standing&quot; of already being glorified is
contingent upon these things. You choose to reject this present
&quot;glorification&quot; if you do not meet God’s criteria.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000" size="3"><b>8) Get God to un-seal you –– Eph. 1:13</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">We are &quot;sealed with the Holy Spirit of
promise.&quot; Notice that the Holy Spirit Himself is the &quot;Seal.&quot; We
are however warned that we should not &quot;grieve&quot; the Holy Spirit of God,
whereby we are sealed (4:30). If you grieve the Spirit, there is a danger. If
there were no danger, God would not have warned us not to grieve the Spirit.
&quot;But the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not
after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For they that are after the flesh do mind
the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the
Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life
and peace. ... so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God&quot;
(Romans 8: 4-8). If one continues in sin, they cannot be at the same time in the
Spirit. If the Spirit is not in them, He has been grieved, and does not seal
them (1 Jn. 3:6-8). It is utterly impossible to be carnally minded and sealed
with the Spirit at the same time. You refuse the Spirit which is the Seal, and
YOU forfeit the seal.</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000" size="3"><b>9) Get God to un-justify you –– Rom.
3:24; 8:30</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">Romans 3:26, &quot;I declare, I say, at this
time his righteousness: that he might be just, <i>and the justifier of him which
<b>believeth</b></i> in Jesus.&quot; Our author has to reconcile the impossible,
which is, that faith and belief are compatible with sin. The Bible is a book
against sin. The purpose and atonement of Christ is to save us <b><u>from </u></b>sin
(Matt. 1:21; 1 Jn. 3:6-9). One is only justified as long as they are believing
with faith. God demands a <i><b>present tense</b></i> faith; Having a <i><b>past</b></i>
faith will not save you. Only those that <i><b>abide</b></i> in Christ will be
saved (Jn.15:1-6). Everything is contingent upon present faith. That is the
fact of both Scripture and logic.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000" size="3"><b>10) Get God to un-bless you –– Eph. 1:3</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">&quot;Blessed be the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
places<b><u><i> in </i></u></b>Christ.&quot; The blessing is clearly contingent
upon our union with Christ. Only those that are <u><i><b>&quot;in&quot;</b></i></u>
Christ are recipients of the blessing. One must however, &quot;remain&quot; in
Christ, and &quot;abide&quot; in Him, to <i><b>be</b></i> <b><i><u>in</u></i></b>
 Him (Jn. 6:27; 8:31; 15:1-11; Acts. 13:43; 14:22; Rom. 2:7, 6:1; 11:23; Gal.
2:5; 3:10; Col. 1:23; 1 Tim. 2:15; 4:16; 2 Tim. 2:3; Heb. 12:7; James 5:11; 1
John 2:6; 2:10; 2:24; 2:27, 28; 3:6; 3:14; 3:24; 2 John 1:9). One must rewrite
the Bible to avoid the necessity of remaining, continuing, and abiding <b><i><u>in</u></i></b>
Christ for salvation.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b><font color="#800000" size="3">11) Get God to un-bury you –– Rom. 6:4;
Col. 2:12</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">Logically, we must see that if we do not
remain in the faith, our past faithfulness will not avail us any benefit (Ezek.
18:4, 24-32; 33:11-20).&nbsp;If you wish to dig up your old life, that is within
your power to do so.</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000" size="3"><b>12) Get God to un-raise you –– Eph. 2:6</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">It is truly grace to be elevated to such a
high position. But this grace is only &quot;through faith&quot; and nowhere else (Eph.
2:8). God does not &quot;un-raise you.&quot; If one loses their
faith, they sink by the gravity of their own sins from this elevated position.
God forces no one to believe! God forces no one to continue in the faith.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000" size="3"><b>13) Get God to un-quicken you –– Eph.
2:1</b></font>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">Romans 6:23, 'The wages of sin is death...'
Being &quot;quickened&quot; is being brought to spiritual life. To Christians,
Paul writes, &quot;Know ye not, that whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey,
his servants ye are to whom you obey; whether of sin unto death, or obedience
unto righteousness?&quot; One is not &quot;un-quickened&quot; just as one is not
&quot;un-birthed...&quot;&nbsp; they DIE! The creation of non-existent
terminology in an effort to make another's position to appear ignorant, is a
distraction, and only reveals the faulty thinking of the accuser in the matter.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">In the parable of the Prodigal Son, (Luke 15),
we see that the <u><b><i>son</i></b></u> willingly left the <b><i><u>Father</u>,</i></b>
and the Father did not stop him. While the Father rushed out to meet him upon
his humble return, it is stated, &quot;For this my <b><i><u>son</u> </i></b>was <b>DEAD,</b>
and <u><b>alive again</b></u>; he was lost (he became that way on his own,) and
is found.&quot; If the son left the Father and continued wallowing with the
pigs, the Father would not have dragged him home. Notice that <u><b>he was a son
before he left!</b></u> He was pronounced <u><b>alive again!</b></u>&nbsp;
Indicating life before he left! Upon his willful departure, he was considered
&quot;dead&quot; and &quot;lost&quot; until his humble return. Christians <i><u>can</u></i>
sin and die spiritually. It is our choice if we lose the life we were quickened
with.</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000" size="3"><b>14) Get God to take Christ out of you
–– Col. 1:27</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">God does not take Christ out of us; we kick
Him out! (Jn. 15:1-11, Jude 21). It took faith to let Him in, and it takes
unbelief to push Him out. If you refuse to abide &quot;in&quot; Christ, you will
be cast forth and burned! &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000" size="3"><b>15) Get God to take you out of Christ’s
physical body –– Eph. 5:30</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">You were at one time not part of His Body, and
while the Body may miss you, it will get along just fine as it did without you
before you were part of the Body. God does not go around with a cancer-ridden
Body. One who claims to be in the Body when they are not, is the cancer that has
always plagued the Church. The poet Southey said, &quot;I could believe in
Christ if he did not drag behind him his leprous bride, the Church.&quot;
Suggesting that your departure from the Body would harm the Body is
overestimating your value and contribution to the whole!</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000">Now, you see how simple that was –– if you can undo
all that God has done for you then you are free and clear once again. Then when
you &quot;repent&quot; and get right then all the above 15 things will happen
again. Then when you &quot;sin it away&quot; again then you can undo it all over
again! My what a life! About as confusing as a termite in a yo-yo! Yes, I know <b><i>all
those</i></b> verses in Matthew (before the cross) and <i><u><b>all those</b></u></i>
verses in Hebrews and James (doctrinally during the tribulation) and of course
Revelation (during the 7 year tribulation where the body of Christ is not
present anyway) –– Yes, <b><i>I’ve seen all those verses</i></b>, had them
thrown out of context at me for over 20 years now.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">Yes, our author has taken the </font><font size="3"><b><i> black marker</i></b></font><font color="#000080" size="3"> of
<a href="Dispensationalism.htm">dispensationalism</a>, and used it freely to blot out all passages that God has
placed at our disposal for edification and instruction in righteousness. He has
decided that he will only believe what he wishes to believe, and will ignore the
relevance of the Scriptures. He is truly one of those that Peter wrote of,
&quot;which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do the other
Scriptures, unto their own destruction&quot; (2 Peter 3:16). &quot;Ye
therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also,
being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness&quot; (2 Peter
3:17).&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000">Until you can show me how a blood-bought, redeemed,
regenerated saint in this age can lose all that God has done for him then I
might give you a listen. Until then I will stay secure in Christ for all
eternity –– glory!!!</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>But even if you do, <u>he will not listen!</u>
He has taken a black marker to his Bible so it cannot disagree with him!</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">For those of <b><i><u>you</u></i></b> that
wish to look at some of these reasons, you can look here.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>&nbsp;<a href="200_reasons.htm"><font color="#800080">200
Reasons You Shouldn’t Believe Eternal Security</font></a></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#800080" size="3"><b><a href="hold_on.htm">Hold On!</a></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>Notice that not one time in this whole line of
argumentation does the author produce a singular Scripture that <u><i>proves</i></u>
his presupposition. No matter how impossible or foolish they can make an
opposing doctrine look, Scripture doctrine cannot be proved without finding it
in Scripture! I can argue that not believing in Santa Claus would result in,
lower spending at Christmas, unemployment of store workers, profit loss in
movies, the disappointed children, and the financial losses suffered upon the
whole economy. These things would be <i>unthinkable</i> to the economists that
wish to promote these things, yet, the fact that some may find their comfort in
Santa Claus, does not prove in any way that there <i>is</i> a Santa Claus! Just
because we do not like the possible consequences that a certain doctrine may
lead us to, it is a foolish reason to reject it. Truth is truth, and it does not
need our permission to be true! And it will remain true whether we reject it or
write it out of our Bibles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>There is no unconditional Eternal Security to be found in
the Scriptures; that's a fact. There are a lot of clever evasions that they can
come up with, but this is where creativity and truth part ways.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><b>My friend, believe the Scriptures, shun sin
and abide in Christ! Cast your faith upon Him and His power to save! Find your
security in Christ! Not upon the fantasies and the selective Scripture reading
of individuals that choose to have more faith in their own private doctrine than
they do the Bible!&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
