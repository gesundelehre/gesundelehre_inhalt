      <p align="justify">This question has arisen from a couple of articles
      online concerning the atonement of Christ, and one in particular where one
      writer considers me a false teacher and on my way to Hell since I deny
      the critical assumption of his precious philosophy! The purpose in
      responding to this attack on my Christianity is to state the truth and to
      save others from the oppression of such misguided vitriol. We will take a
      look at these malicious accusations, and face them directly. The
      accusation is that being against the doctrine of Penal Substitution makes
      one have a false Gospel, and a false Christ. The inevitable result is that
      those who do not believe this philosophical doctrinal nonsense are not
      even Christian at all! While I have always been open to Biblically based
      correction, I can only accept that which actually has substance behind the
      correction. Several writers on the internet, and some noted theologians
      have discarded the life-giving Gospel of salvation by grace though faith,
      for a &quot;gospel&quot; based upon ascent to the soul-stifling doctrine of Penal Substitution. I do not fault them for
      their passion, but their judgment.</p>
      <p align="justify">I cannot allow this bold lie that destroys salvation by
      grace through faith to go unchallenged. These assertions must be answered,
      and the ugly truth about how people's allegiance to their philosophy so
      easily outweighs their commitment to the Bible will be exposed. It is sad
      to see how such a mixture of philosophy and misapplied Scripture makes
      fools of otherwise intelligent men. Approaching truth through philosophy,
      and not Scripture alone will eventually place one in opposition to sound
      Biblical theology. The two are like oil and water. The humanistic oil of
      philosophy will taint the pure water of the Word. These two elements
      always seems to separate over time, with the philosophical oil dominating
      over the Scriptural water. This is the case with the Theory of Penal
      Substitution and these writers.</p>
      <p align="justify">In the process of facing their baseless accusations,
      several questions will be answered; (1) does opposition to Penal
      Substitution place one outside of the Christian fold? (2) Is belief in the
      particular theory of Penal Substitution a requirement for every believer's
      salvation? (3) Is the doctrine even Biblical? (4) What is the fate of
      those who teach it as part of the Gospel? These are critical accusations
      that demand sure answers! If it is Biblical, then those that oppose this
      doctrine should repent immediately for the sake of their souls! If the
      teaching is false, the addition of it to the Christian system is a
      doctrinal tragedy at best, and heresy at the worst.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify">In response to these graceless and unfounded dogmatic
      statements, I will note that the author states nothing in the way of a
      single Biblical proof &quot;for&quot; Penal Substitution in the entire
      article! He does give a short reference to Leviticus and a sacrifice as
      the point of his conversion to this belief. He alludes to the idea of the
      scapegoat, along with his personal eisegetical presuppositions that the
      sacrifice was &quot;Penal&quot; in nature. In the Old Testament where the the death
      of the sacrifice occurs, he appears ignorant of several <b>Biblical facts!</b> (1) <u>Nowhere
      in <b>all of Scripture</b> is it said that God viewed the sacrifice as
      being &quot;punished.</u>&quot; The purpose revealed was grace and
      redemption, not judgment and punishment of the sacrifice. The scapegoat is
      figurative, not of transfer of guilt, but of the innocent substitute
      taking away the sin. So the message was intended to state a figure of
      expiation, not transfer of guilt and subsequent punishment. The Scriptures
      are careful to use the term &quot;suffering&quot; when speaking of what
      the sacrifice endures, which is not punishment. You cannot punish the
      innocent; they can only suffer the punishment due to the guilty. In
      Scripture we see that a minimum of 21 times it refers to the work of
      Christ on our behalf as &quot;suffering,&quot; yet not once is it said in
      Scripture that Jesus was punished or that He was the subject of God's
      wrath. The Old Testament sacrificial lamb was not <b>punished</b> (Penal
      Theory) for someone's sins any more than Jesus was for ours! (2) In
      Hebrews 10:4 we are told, &quot;<b>For it is impossible for the blood of
      bulls and goats to take away sins</b>.&quot; God says that the Old
      Testament sacrifices did not take away sins. Our proponent of Penal
      Substitution interjects his circular reasoning, based upon the doctrines
      of Calvinism, causing him to say that the actual sins of the sinner were
      successfully transferred to the sacrifice, which Hebrews 10:4 denies by
      clear implication. Shallow circular reasoning, and extensively quoting
      those &quot;big names&quot; that agree with his doctrine, is not in any
      way a <b><u>Biblical defense</u></b> of the doctrine, but a lame attempt
      at mere philosophical &quot;group-think&quot; appeal.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify">His idea is that <b>I am</b> &quot;<b>unregenerate</b>&quot;
      by referring to 1 Cor. 2:14, is a case in point how this man distorts the
      Scriptures to his own destruction! 1 Cor. 2:14 says, &quot;But the natural
      man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God.&quot; <u>Strangely,
      God never said anything here about Penal Substitution</u>. This alleged
      defense is nothing more than the so-called &quot;<b>Spirit Card</b>&quot;
      that is swiftly thrown down to silence an argument, i.e., &quot;I know
      that I am led by the Spirit, and though I don't have any solid Scripture
      that proves my position, I know that God tells me it is true! If you don't
      agree with me, you can't possibly be hearing from my God!&quot; A.K.A.,
      &quot;If you don't agree with super-spiritual <b>me</b>, you're obviously
      not spiritual or even a Christian; no debate--go to Hell, do not collect
      $200.&quot;</p>
      <p align="justify"><b>I am not</b> &quot;<b>spiritual</b>&quot; in his
      estimation. Mr. Andrews supposedly &quot;proves&quot; this by appealing to
      1 Cor.2:15, &quot;but he who is spiritual appraises all things...&quot;
      Basically, his argument is, if I &quot;appraise&quot; or &quot;judge
      right&quot; according to the Scriptures, I would agree with him. Since I
      do not agree, he feels justified by the rigidity of his own convictions to
      place himself as my Judge, while his whole doctrinal defense is summed up
      in his refusal to peer over the wall of his own philosophical
      presuppositions. His strong-armed approach to proving doctrine is nothing
      less than blind unsubstantiated dogmatism! He wants to &quot;bully&quot;
      people into believing his argument by terrorizing them with threats of
      eternal damnation. But it boils down to this; the only difference between
      his method of evangelism and a Muslim terrorist is a literal sword. People
      need not fear his threats of eternal damnation; he is not God, and does
      not have God's endorsement for his theory or condemnation based upon a
      doctrine of the atonement. <u><b>The Gospel never demands any ascent to
      any specific view of atonement</b></u>. <u><b>It is faith in the Person
      and work of Jesus Christ</b></u>. <u><b>Salvation is by grace through
      faith-never of faith plus Penal Substitution</b></u>!</p>
      <p align="justify">Some, like the following writer believe that my
      &quot;Christ&quot; is counterfeit, solely on the basis that I do not
      accept his theory of the atonement!</p>
      <p align="justify">As we can see, <b><u>Penal substitution has been made
      into the Gospel itself</u></b> by many of this Calvinistic Cult. Even John
      Calvin had sense enough not to teach it! (Boy is he in trouble!) Penal
      Substitution is not the only doctrine or means by which this cult seeks to
      equate with the Gospel. See <a href="http://eternalsecurity.us/once_saved_always_saved%20a%20substitute%20for%20grace.htm">Eternal
      Security; A Substitute for Grace</a>.</p>
      <p align="justify">This is not the first time, or the last that someone
      will infer that a person is lost if they don't believe some unbiblical
      doctrine! This spiritually coercive fraud is the mainstay of nearly every
      cult!</p>
      <p align="justify">Reverend Byrn MacPhail takes a huge leap into cult
      territory by saying:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff">The theory of penal
        substitution may not delineate every aspect of the Christian gospel,
        yet, we must nonetheless confess that: <i>The gospel minus penal
        substitution is no gospel at all</i>.</font>[2]</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify">What is strange about the argument is that he admits
      shortcomings in his own theory of the atonement, yet these people reject
      any other theory based upon the idea that they do not adequately delineate
      every aspect of the Christian Gospel! A strange self-contradictory
      standard indeed!</p>
      <p align="justify"><b>For any doctrine to be Biblical</b>, <b>it must be
      stated in the Bible</b>. Penal Substitution is not in the Bible and
      therefore not a Biblical doctrine! How then, can Penal Substitution be
      part of the Gospel when it is not taught in Scripture? Everywhere the
      Gospel is preached in the Scriptures it always omits any reference to
      Penal Substitution. One thing we do know for sure, the Scriptures clearly
      say that <b><font color="#008000">The Gospel <u>minus</u> Penal
      Substitution <u>IS</u> the Gospel <u>according to the Bible</u></font></b>!</p>
      <p align="justify">If these false teachers believe this so passionately,
      don't you think that they must prove their bold assertions? <b><u>Where is
      the statement in Scripture that appends the acceptance of Penal
      Substitution to the Gospel pla</u>n</b>? Where do we see, &quot;<b>If you
      confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord</b>, <b>and believe in your heart in
      Penal Substitution</b>, <b>you shall be saved</b>...&quot;?</p>
      <p align="justify">If these writers cannot prove it, (which they cannot),
      then how can they condescendingly insist that someone does not have the
      Gospel without it? This is without a doubt <b>spiritual quackery</b>!
      Performing spiritual services without any authority from God! They are
      writing religious prescriptions for something we do not need, making their
      delusional doctrinal drug a substitute for a healthy, unadulterated
      Gospel!</p>
      <p align="justify">Mr. Dave Jenkins states this error even more boldly:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <div align="justify">
          <font color="#0000ff">Mr. C---'s and the E----V---'s <u>denial of
          penal substitution is a denial of Christianity itself</u>. The Bible
          makes it clear how believers are justified, and as will be shown
          further, <u>any view that opposes</u> justification by faith, and or <u>penal
          substitution opposes the Gospel that God gave people through His Word</u>.
          T<u>he rejection of the doctrine of penal substitution is a rejection
          of the Gospel itself</u>.[3]</font>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify">It is perplexing that in our enlightened day that one
      must have to deal with such absurd statements! People like Mr. Jenkins
      must answer the obvious; what do we do with all those Christians before
      the invention of the Penal Theory in the 16th century? Such troubling
      statements as a <font color="#0000FF">&quot;<u>denial of Penal
      Substitution is a denial of Christianity itself</u>,&quot;</font> either
      proves that no one was ever saved before Calvinism, or that those that
      would make such ridiculously stupid claims are arrogantly ignorant of
      Christian history, without love for their Christian brothers, or
      incompetent expounders of the Word of God!</p>
      <p align="justify">Jenkins further whines in protest saying <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Penal
      substitution is clearly taught in Isaiah 53, so the charge that penal
      substitution is a form of 'cosmic child abuse' cannot be sustained in
      light of the text of Isaiah 53.&quot;</font> I would say that Isaiah 53 is
      clearly a denial of Penal Substitution when it is looked at without
      &quot;Penal&quot; presuppositions! I also understand that the
      suggestion that Penal Substitution is tantamount to &quot;cosmic child
      abuse&quot; is an offensive thought to the proponents of the Penal
      doctrine, but like it or not, it is the inevitable result of the Penal
      doctrine! Appealing to Isaiah 53 does nothing to dislodge such an
      inevitable conclusion. Appealing to Scripture does not undo the logical
      outcome of a bad doctrine, without proving at the same time that the
      doctrine itself is wrong! If I were to beat and murder my own child so
      that the guilty could be acquitted, there is not a court or sane person in
      the entire world that would not justly condemn me as a monster!</p>
      <p align="justify">In response to the Isaiah 53 argument I have stated,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <div align="justify">
          <font color="#008000">Doesn't Isaiah 53:4-5, state that while Jesus
          was on the cross, God was going to punish Him? 'Surely our grief's He
          himself bore, And our sorrows he carried: Yet we ourselves esteemed
          him stricken, Smitten of God and afflicted, But He was pierced through
          for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; The
          chastening for our well being fell upon Him, And by His scourging we
          are healed.&quot; This is without a doubt the clearest prophecy about
          the nature of the atonement the Messiah was to suffer. Most who see a
          penal theme to this have not ever read the prophecy without a
          preconceived bias. Notice that it says, <u><i><b>we</b></i></u>
          esteemed him as stricken, smitten by God. </font><font color="#000000">Notice
          that it does not say that &quot;God esteemed Him as under His wrath!
          Why would Isaiah write this but for the purpose of showing the stark
          contrast between the people's erroneous opinion of what happened on
          the Cross, and what God Himself knows that happened? </font><font color="#008000">Those
          who saw Christ suffer, instead of understanding that he was bearing
          the weight of the sins of others in a mediatorial capacity, imagined
          that he was suffering at God's hands for his own sins. God knew that
          people would misconceive what was transpiring on the cross. The
          passage does not state implicitly or indirectly that God was to smite
          him in any way. </font><font color="#000000">Penal Substitutionists
          force <b><i><u>we</u></i></b> esteemed Him as stricken, smitten of
          God...&quot; to mean that <b><u>God</u></b> esteemed Jesus as
          stricken, and under the Father's wrath and punishment. It is clear
          that Isaiah is pointing out that the &quot;people&quot; just aren't going
          to get it right! He is setting the record straight in advance to save
          us from such misconceptions as the Penal Theory!</font>

          the idea of punishment. It can carry the idea of discipline and
          correction. Keep in mind that if someone bears the
          &quot;chastisement&quot; for you, does not mean that they were
          punished. Punishment requires guilt. To suffer the consequences of the
          penalty for another is not strictly punishment.</font>

          will do the bruising. But the crucifixion could not have occurred
          apart from God willing, and allowing it happen. In view of this, and
          that God foreknew the result that atonement would bring, it can be
          said that God was pleased to bruise him. It brought the desired
          result; reconciliation between God and man. The Trinity, working as

          &quot;forsaking&quot; without separating. It means to refuse to rescue
          from this situation. For many reasons we must consider viable options

          <font color="#008000">The words, &quot;<b>My God</b>, <b>my God</b>, <b>why
          hast thou forsaken me</b>?&quot; refer back to Psalm 22, which is a
          prophecy of the gruesome death that the Messiah was to suffer. The
          Psalm illuminates our first option by stating &quot;why are thou so
          far from helping me?&quot; The question resides in which way was God
          &quot;far from helping Him,&quot; and &quot;forsaking&quot; him. The
          text of Psalm 22 reveals this a little more clearly. The abandonment
          that was experienced was not a separation in the Trinity because of
          the Father's displeasure, but an abandonment to suffering. In Psalm
          22:1, it was the <i>feeling</i> of the righteous man that God is
          &quot;far from helping him.&quot; To say that this is depicting an
          actual separation from God is out of harmony with subsequent verses
          that express the righteous man's confidence in God's presence and
          help. (verses 4, 9, 19.)</font>

          <font color="#ff8000">A couple of remaining verses deserve comment.
          One is 1 Peter 2:24, which states that Christ &quot;himself bore [or
          &quot;carried up&quot;] our sins in his body on the tree&quot; (NIV).
          This verse appears in a passage which quotes from Isaiah 53, virtually
          the only Scriptural passage which may clearly support Substitution.
          Yet Matthew did not interpret Isaiah in that way. According to
          Matthew, &quot;He took up our infirmities and carried our
          diseases&quot; (Isa. 53:4, NIV) meant not that infirmities were
          vicariously imputed to Christ at his crucifixion, but rather that
          Christ healed the sick, thus &quot;carrying&quot; or
          &quot;bearing&quot; their diseases away from them (Matt. 8:16,17).</font>

      splitting hairs here. Suffering or punishment, it's all the same, right?
      No, it is not the same! In order for a man to be punished, he must be
      guilty. To inflict what is due for punishment upon an innocent man is an
      injustice. But if a man voluntarily suffers in another's place to whom
      punishment is due, it is self-sacrifice and heroism. If it is inflicted by
      an arbitrary authority, it is injustice on one side, and martyrdom on the
      other. If I go to jail on the charge of murder, but I am innocent, then I
      am not punished, because I am not guilty. All I suffer is an injustice.

      huge amounts of scripture, even though none of them apply to the argument

      the death of Beza in 1605 is

      Gospel! Any rational Christian would conclude that the addition of a Penal Atonement

      &quot;count&quot; or &quot;account&quot; something as the original Greek
      language understood it? Can we by the gusty breeze of pure Calvinian bias,
      interject some idea into the passage that some writer at Crosswork.org

      &quot;assumes&quot; that God exists, and it makes no effort to prove it.
      Just because there are times that something is assumed in Scriptural

      Calvinists at Crosswork.org wished to &quot;assume&quot; was behind the
      scenes a full 2000 years later?</b>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify">One word seems to describe this &quot;learned
      Doctor's&quot; argument that we can just insert payment of sins,
      punishment of Christ on the Cross, and some sort of mystical transfer of
      sins by magical imputation of character from one person to another. The
      word is <b><u>ABSURD</u>!</b></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;The word is a translation of the Greek word <b><i>LOGIZOMAI</i></b>
      which is an accounting term which means to count, or put to someone's
      account. The same word is translated as impute ( Rom. 4:6, 8, 11, 22, 23,
      24), reckon, (Rom. 4:4, 9, 10), numbered (Mark 15:28), laid to their
      charge (2 Tim. 4:16), counted (Rom. 2:26, 4:3, 5; 9:8), accounting (Heb.
      11:19). It is interesting to mark that the term of reckon and counting can
      be interchanged in all instances of &quot;impute.&quot; Another point is
      that to &quot;reckon&quot; and to &quot;count&quot; do not carry the idea
      of any mystical transfer of character. The actual meaning of the word
      &quot;impute&quot; does not carry this idea without the theological
      imposition that has been put upon it.</p>

      ammunition in short order and has resorted to getting personal. So, since in his mind I

      another.&quot;</font></p>

      might equally say that faith is acknowledged to him for righteousness, or
      even better that righteousness is allotted to the believer... If God
      counts faith as righteous, man is wholly righteous in God's eyes.&quot; <font color="#000000">Astonishingly,
      after nine entire pages discussing this singular word alone, Kittle
      completely misses the opportunity to tell us that it ever means &quot;to

      which, starting with ascertainable facts, draws a conclusion, especially a
      mathematical one or one pertaining to business, where calculations are
      essential.&quot;</font> It seems as if Doctor Brown is just another
      heretical Greek expert that we are supposed to disregard. On page 825 he
      deals with the Romans chapter three verses this way: <font color="#ff8000">&quot;In
      Rom. 4:3-6, 8, 10, 22 ff., and Gal. 3:6 ...The rabbi's thinking was purely
      human; for them faith was merit. Paul wished to recon as God did, who
      reckoned salvation and righteousness on the basis of his promise ( Rom.
      8:9), and what he promises he performs.&quot;</font> How could he possibly
      agree with a false teacher as me? How could he neglect to mention how God
      transfers sin through Penal imputation?</p>

                  Christ's righteousness is mystically transferred to us so that
                  God doesn't really see our sins; rather He sees us as
                  spotlessly holy in Christ? No one here denies that we are
                  &quot;accounted righteous&quot; by the work of Christ. What is
                  denied is what these Scriptures never say, i.e., God does not see
                  our sins if we sin, because God (literally) transfers the
                  righteousness of Christ to us so He cannot see our sins.<br>

                <div align="justify">
                  (2) Instead of the absurd image that as we sin, someone holds
                  up a poster of Jesus in front of the Omniscient God of all
                  truth, and He lies and says that He cannot know or see our

                  (3) When we come to Christ in repentance and faith, we are
                  forgiven of all of the sins we have committed. At that moment,
                  with all our sins forgiven, are we not <u> counted</u> righteous
                  before God? No mystical transfer occurs, no fictitious
                  righteousness when we are not, but a simple accounting of
                  righteousness based on the forgiveness we receive through
                  faith. We do not need unbiblical mysticism to understand the
                  simplicity of being counted righteous.

      have adopted this fiction must ignore the fact that God is all knowing and
      cannot be fooled as to the true character of an individual. It ignores the
      fact that God is the God of all truth, He cannot lie. So how can it be
      said that God can be the all knowing God of truth and call that which is
      unholy something other than what it is? If we are to follow this logic,
      many try to extricate themselves from this difficulty by saying that God
      can see the sin but it only affects our fellowship and not our
      relationship. But the idea of broken fellowship cannot be reconciled with
      this doctrine of imputed righteousness. Taylor says, &quot;If God sees not
      my sin but my position in Christ, if He views me as clothed in Christ's
      righteousness, then how could sin - which has been put to Christ's account
      &quot; break fellowship?&quot; This mysticism and unscriptural idea that
      character can be transferred from one individual to another is the glue
      that holds Mr. Stanley's false assertions together. The logical course of
      the Eternal Securist who cannot find a clear and decisive Scripture to
      defend their position is to fall back upon their <b>twist</b> on the
      atonement. 2Pe 3:16 as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these

      <p align="justify">By dogmatically asserting that &quot;Penal Substitution
      is the Gospel,&quot; many seek to scare people into compliance with a

      to perform a <u><font color="#008000">spiritual shakedown</font></u> via
      human manipulation; this is nothing more than Satanically inspired fear mongering!</b> Adding Penal
      Substitution to the Gospel is the same thing as adding circumcision to the
      Gospel in the Church of Galatia. It is a &quot;<b><font color="#CA0000">gospel
      that is contrary</font></b>&quot;<font color="#000000"> to what Paul and
      the Apostles preached.</font> <u>I don't believe that God would see a glob
      of Calvinistic leaven as any less dangerous than a pinch of Jewish leaven.</u>
      Though Galatians deals specifically with the Jewish Law-keeping of the Old
      Testament being forced upon Christians saved by grace through faith in
      Jesus Christ alone, any additional requirement (a &quot;law&quot; to
      believe a doctrine not in the Scriptures), is a violation of the same
      principle involved. Paul writes, &quot;<font color="#ff0000">in order that
      in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so
      that <u>we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith</u>.
      Brethren, I speak in terms of human relations; even though it is only a
      man's covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside <u>or
      adds conditions to it</u>.</font>&quot; Gal. 3:14-15.</p>
      <p align="justify">To add Penal Substitution to the Gospel is to violate
      the principle. &quot;<font color="#ff0000">You have been severed from
      Christ, you who seek are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen
      from grace</font>.&quot; Gal. 5:4</p>
      <p align="justify">Attempting to justify oneself by the Old Testament Law,
      or man's additional requirement to grace, voids grace and places ones
      faith in oneself, one's doctrine, or one's law-keeping for salvation. You
      cut yourself off from God's grace when you do so! Since adding Penal
      Substitution to the Gospel by default changes the Gospel of Jesus Christ
      according to the Scriptures, how can it be that Penal Substitution is not
      in God's eyes, &quot;<font color="#CA0000"><b>another</b></font>&quot;
      gospel?</p>
      <p align="justify">Allow me to compliment the theory of Penal Substitution
      on one specific level. It is without a doubt great <b><i>philosophy</i></b>.
      But having said that, also allow me to observe the truth that <b><i>philosophy
      is not theology</i></b>. Philosophy is based upon human reason as the
      arbiter of all truth. Theology however, is determined by what the inspired
      Scriptures say is true. This does not mean that Theology is essentially
      self-contradictory, but it does mean that what God says is true, is always
      true whether our human minds can wrap itself around it, or comprehend it.
      Basically, if we cannot systemize it (like many philosophers demand that
      we do), it does not mean that it is not true, contrary to those sophists
      that would say otherwise.</p>
      <p align="justify">What I am alluding to is, no matter how someone
      perceives the atonement of Christ, as long as that &quot;view&quot; of the
      atonement states that in our present condition, the work of Jesus Christ
      on the Cross on our behalf is <u>the sole means by which we can be saved</u>,
      it does not matter one iota what someone believes, <u>salvation wise</u>.
      One does not have to be an academic or comprehend complex doctrines or
      theological systems in order to be saved. The bible preaches a simple
      faith in a simple Gospel. Yes! We have to identify with the <b><u>true
      Christ</u></b> of the Scriptures, but who of us, to include the brightest
      theologians of all time can say that they know with absolute complete
      accuracy, every
      little aspect of Jesus Christ and God Himself? Good grief! We don't even
      know ourselves that well! Shame on those who would declare one of God's
      little one's to be lost because they cannot expound cogently about
      doctrinal Calvinism!</p>
      <p align="justify"><b>While I respect people's efforts to understand just
      what did happen on the Cross on our behalf, I just do not see how
      Christian love and unity is so easily discarded over something that the
      Scriptures never include as part of the Gospel.</b> Why divide and heap
      damnation on others over a theological point that has no bearing on a
      person's salvation whatsoever? <b>Is a mindless dedication to a theory of
      the atonement so precious and dear to the <u><font color="#008000">philosophically
      committed</font></u>, that they feel justified in adding it to the Gospel?
      </b>Apparently so! It reminds me of a petulant child, the sign of a
      spiritual immaturity that insists on having total theological domination
      over another. Their &quot;spiritual&quot; stomping of feet dishonors the
      spirit of the Gospel, especially when it comes to the point of damning
      anyone that doesn't agree with them on every petty point. <b><u>This my
      friends, is firmly a cult attitude and not a Christian attribute!</u></b>
      To me, all I see happening here is that people are adding their doctrine
      and amending the Gospel of Christ...it's their way or the highway! It is
      the way of the Sophist and not the Theologian! It is the way of humanism
      and not the Biblical path of faith! It is called &quot;<b><u><font color="#008000">Doctrinal
      Regeneration</font></u></b>,&quot; i.e., being regenerated by the Spirit
      only after an intellectual assent to a specific doctrine other than the
      work of Christ alone. Doctrinal Regenerationists, like these men, are
      seeking to establish theological cult that is no less damning to the soul
      than Mormonism and Russellism!</p>
      <p align="justify">There is a philosophical strategy behind their
      insistence that Penal Substitution is the Gospel. By blindly accepting
      their Calvinistic Theory of the atonement, they know that a person would
      be illogical in being anything less than a full-blown Calvinist. It is a
      theory specifically created for Calvinism and to support Calvinism; its
      circular logic leads to only <u>one conclusion</u>-Calvin's <b><u><font color="#008000">doctrinal
      Fatalism</font></u></b>. However, I would not reject the theory on the
      flimsy basis that I don't want to be a Calvinist, but because I see the
      Scriptures as teaching something else, and teaching things that are in
      direct opposition to Calvinism. I see no evidence that supports Penal
      Substitution as they define it. <b>They can find these doctrines in their
      own philosophical minds, and they can &quot;read it into&quot; the
      Scriptures, but they can never prove them <u>from</u> the Scriptures.
      Unless you pre-suppose the doctrine to be true, none of the so-called
      &quot;proof-texts&quot; can possibly say what they seek to inject into
      them!</b></p>

                </p>
                <p><b>FACT!</b> No passage in Scripture supports the idea of a
                literal <b>transfer of guilt or righteousness</b>. Penal
                Substitution must get you to rely on a mysticism that Scripture never
                states, implies, infers, or even hints at in the
                least. It is purely circular philosophy; they must have this
                occur at any cost, or
                their &quot;Theory&quot; of Penal Substitution cannot take place! Here, human
                philosophy is given preeminence over Scripture, with a deceptive
                arrogance to call it Biblical, and topping the whole fiasco off
                with the audacity of damning you for not
                believing it!</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><b>The plain <u>fact</u> is that you cannot reconcile
      Penal Substitution with the Word of God! </b>To teach others that this is <u>Scriptural</u>,
      and not just a theory, or to base any doctrine on such a theory and
      calling it &quot;Biblical,&quot; is a horrible deception. To go on
      claiming that Penal Substitution <b><u><i><font color="#008000">is</font></i></u></b>
      the Gospel takes it further to the point of a soul damning fraud.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify">Now that you know the <b><u><font color="#008000">Facts</font></u></b>,
      you cannot deny the truth. To teach Penal Substitution as Biblical is
      falling right into Satan's hands. Preachers who continue to do so after
      reading this are in defiance of the Word, and God Himself. Claims of
      pragmatism will not cut it on the Day of Judgment. Substituting your ideas
      about the atonement of Christ and calling it &quot;scripture&quot; or
      biblical, makes you a willful deceiver and unworthy to occupy any pulpit
      of the Living Christ!</p>
      <p align="justify">If anyone who does not uphold Penal Substitution is
      worshiping &quot;another Christ,&quot; then those who disagree with the
      Penal Theory do not have the same &quot;gospel&quot; as those who have
      unlovingly exchanged the light of Gospel grace for the darkness of the
      human philosophy of Penal Substitution! Yes I said philosophy and not
      theology! In order for something to be theological, it must spring forth
      from the Scriptures; Penal Substitution does not. If Penal Substitution is
      not ion the Bible, (and even if it were, it is not ever presented as having
      any part of the &quot;Gospel&quot;), it would be no less a heretical crime
      of changing the Gospel of Jesus Christ than if a Mormon or Jehovah's
      Witness were to change it! It is tantamount to &quot;adding&quot; to the
      words of Scripture something that is just not there, and requiring people
      to believe it in order to be saved! <b>The audacity of those who feel they
      are so wise as to &quot;correct&quot; the very Gospel of Christ!</b></p>
      <p align="justify">While I would firmly say that it does not matter how
      someone understands the atonement of Jesus Christ in order to be saved, it
      is an unforgivable crime to amend the true Gospel of Christ to include
      adding a specific doctrine of atonement to it. The Bible NEVER requires,
      nor adds a requirement to believe any certain theory of the atonement as
      part of the Gospel! Adding <b><u>anything</u></b> to the Gospel destroys
      it! By the addition it becomes &quot;another gospel&quot; which is not the
      same as the true Gospel of Jesus Christ! Mind you, I would say the very
      same thing if anyone &quot;added&quot; <b><u>MY</u></b> view of the
      atonement as a requirement for salvation! According to our dissenting
      opponent about the doctrine, either he is right, and everyone who
      disagrees with him is bound for hell, or, God's Gospel is much bigger than
      his narrow doctrine, and therefore, his position is heresy!&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify">The sad irony of the whole argument from our opponents
      inclusion of the Penal THEORY as intrinsic to the Gospel is, they condemn
      themselves by their very own argument. If taking away something that is
      essential to the Gospel results in eternal condemnation, then what does
      adding something that is so clearly not part of the Gospel, or the
      Scriptures, do to <b><u>them</u></b>? They in essence, have elevated their
      corrupted &quot;gospel&quot; to be superior to the genuine Gospel of Jesus
      Christ! What condemnation awaits those who are so arrogant as to insist
      that they are wiser than God Himself, correcting God's salvation plan to
      include a mindless doctrinal ascent to Calvinism for salvation? They
      apparently have no place for salvation by grace through faith in Jesus
      Christ alone! They feel they must add unbending faith in the THEORY of
      Penal Substitution as part of the Gospel plan; a stupid and fatal decision
      indeed!</p>
      <p align="justify">I conclude that their false &quot;gospel&quot; is not
      only an insult to the sincere believer who is redeemed by the Savior's
      blood, but an insult of eternal proportions to Giver of salvation Himself!
      I have no delusion however, that those Demagogues that love their
      philosophy more than Christ will continue to preach this falsity to their
      willing school of useful idiots. It must be openly opposed because,
      unfortunately, nothing endures and
      propagates quite like bad theology. Misguided religious fascism will
      always find its home in the darkened heart of men! </p>
